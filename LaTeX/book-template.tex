\chapter*{前言}

按照西方教材的传统，在目录之前一般会给出一句话。
言明作者把本书献给谁，以表达作者的某种情怀。通常是作者的朋友，家人。
令人我印象深刻的是J.K.罗琳女士在她的第7本小说中写到：
\begin{chapquote}{J. K. Rowling,\textit{Harry Potter AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS}}
  ``Thededication of this book Is split seven ways: 
  
  To Neil, To Jessica, To David, To Kenzie, To Di, To Anne, 
  
  And to you, 
  
  If you have stuck with Harry until the very end. 
  ''
\end{chapquote}
同样本书献给吉林大学物理学院15级之后所有的学妹（以及学弟们），
当你们完成电动力学的考试时回想自己三年前，学习物理学的想法。一定会有很多感触吧。

言归正传，本书收录吉林大学物理学院电动力学课程的2004级到2015级往年试题
我们会给出试题参考解答。尽力做到详细，准确且便于理解。
当然本书的解答方式主要基于吉大物院电动力学课本。
不过希望学弟学妹们除了我们的课本外，也去看看郭硕鸿先生以及格里菲斯先生的电动力学教材。
最后祝学弟学妹们前途似锦。

爱你们的

学长
